// 3 ways to send transactions from the contract
// transfer
// send 
// call

//TRANSFER  
// msg.sender is of address type where as payable(msg.sender) is of payable address type through which we can send native blockchain currency
payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);  //this refers to this contract


//SEND

//CALL
// whatever data this fn returns would be set to dataReturned 
// if fn successfully called callSuccess will be true otherwise false
//here not calling any fn, we are treating this as transaction
